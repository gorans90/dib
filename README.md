Dib task

This task has been done using following tech stack: Java 8, Spring Boot, Hibernate, H2 database (I use H2 
 because this is for testing purpose, for production it should be changed to some else db, MSSQL, MySql etc)
I selected these tech stack because I feel most comfortable with it.

Start project with command:
`mvn spring-boot:run` 

Once project is started you can find swagger on the following link:

CURL command for init data, but I also want to notice that initialization has been added on project startup:

CURL command for getting beer by id:
 * curl -X GET "http://localhost:8078/dib/beer/1" -H "accept: application/json"

     "name": "Declassified Demi-God",

  }
 ~~~~

     "description": "BrewDog vs Cloudwater is a 6.8% Vermont-style India Pale Ale, hopped with Mosaic in the whirlpool only. Without any big- hitting additions of hops in the boil, we carried the flavour by heavily dry-hopping the brew with Citra and Mosaic. We also used oats in the recipe to deliver the trademark smooth mouthfeel â€“ and made it truly authentic by propagating a one-off culture of Vermont yeast, specifically for the brew.",
     "mash_temp": 68
   }
